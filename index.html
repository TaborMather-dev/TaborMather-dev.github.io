        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><ind>Hello! My name is Tabor, and I am from Portland, OR. I am US Aif force veteran who served
        as a Dental Technician. I have worked in several different fields such as food service, shipping,
        HVAC, and warehousing. I have always had an interest in how computers read code and translate information
        back to us. Although I am in my early 30's and just getting started with my code-writing career, I look
        forward to learning new things, and hopefully being a part of the future of this exciting field.
        Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio website!</p>
